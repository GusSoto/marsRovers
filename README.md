# marsRovers
The first thing I did was understand the behavior that the rover should have based on the instructions provided. Then define the elements of the application and how they will integrate with each other.The program works with valid movements within the grid depending on the direction of the rover.
Move up
Move down
Move Right
Move Left
The program works with a file that contains the input data. These data can be modified to validate other scenarios.
As I said, this program is focused on giving a correct answer, with this information we can extend the program I don't know, maybe getting all the points visited on the grid or things like that.
